## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this school district analysis is to assist Maria, the chief Data Scientist for a city school system, in analyzing data on school funding and test scores. By analyzing all student standardized test reading and math scores in conjunction with various information on the schools they attend we can then compile this data to provide insight on performance trends. These findings can then be used to assist the school board in making important decisions on school budgets and lesson priorities. These findings can also be applied at both a school and district level.
